# critcl-spec

This RPM spec is used to create a openSUSE RPM for [critcl](https://github.com/andreas-kupries/critcl).

Notice: I am not sure it is done for everything.
The spec creates 2 RPM files.
It is for openSUSE build service request (put header files to devel package).
Now I put total package files to devel package (maybe have better solution).

So -  
First package has files -  critcl, license.terms and README.md.
Second package (devel) has another files.
